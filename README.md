## Stock Price Prediction using LSTM


This project is focused on predicting stock prices for the "Accor" company using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its ability to capture sequential patterns in data, making it well-suited for time series forecasting tasks like stock price prediction.

### Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict the stock prices of the "Accor" company using historical stock price data. LSTM, being a powerful deep learning model for sequence prediction tasks, is employed to learn and model the patterns in the stock price movements.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical stock price data for the "Accor" company. It includes the date and closing price for each trading day. The data is organized in a time-series format.

The dataset can be obtained from [Link to the Dataset- "https://www.kaggle.com/code/sakshijain27/stock-price-prediction-using-lstm/input"
] or you can use any publicly available financial data API to fetch the stock prices.

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `stock_price_prediction.ipynb`:


2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, build the LSTM model, and train it on the stock price data.

3. After training, the model will make predictions on the test set. The notebook will also provide evaluation metrics and visualizations to assess the model's performance.

## Results

The LSTM model's predictions on the test set will be visualized to show how well the model captures the stock price movements. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) will be presented to quantify the model's accuracy.
