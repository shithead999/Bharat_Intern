## Task-1
## Stock Price Prediction using LSTM


This project is focused on predicting stock prices for the "Accor" company using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its ability to capture sequential patterns in data, making it well-suited for time series forecasting tasks like stock price prediction.

### Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict the stock prices of the "Accor" company using historical stock price data. LSTM, being a powerful deep learning model for sequence prediction tasks, is employed to learn and model the patterns in the stock price movements.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical stock price data for the "Accor" company. It includes the date and closing price for each trading day. The data is organized in a time-series format.

The dataset can be obtained from [Link to the Dataset- "https://www.kaggle.com/code/sakshijain27/stock-price-prediction-using-lstm/input"
] or you can use any publicly available financial data API to fetch the stock prices.

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `stock_price_prediction.ipynb`:


2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, build the LSTM model, and train it on the stock price data.

3. After training, the model will make predictions on the test set. The notebook will also provide evaluation metrics and visualizations to assess the model's performance.

## Results

The LSTM model's predictions on the test set will be visualized to show how well the model captures the stock price movements. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) will be presented to quantify the model's accuracy.

Example Result:

## Task-2
# Titanic Survivor Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning models such as F1 score, logistic regression, precision score, and recall score. Extensive data visualization is performed to analyze factors that could potentially influence the survival of passengers on the Titanic.

## Introduction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. In this project, we aim to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. Various factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and more are considered to build and evaluate predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains passenger information from the Titanic, including attributes like age, sex, ticket class, number of siblings/spouses, number of parents/children, fare, and cabin information. The dataset also contains a binary target variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).

The dataset can be obtained from [https://www.kaggle.com/code/sakshijain27/titanic-survivors/input] 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or higher) along with Jupyter Notebook.

3. Install the required dependencies:


## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `titanic_survivors.ipynb`:


2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to explore and preprocess the dataset, perform data visualization to gain insights into the factors affecting survival, build machine learning models (F1 score, logistic regression, precision score, recall score), and evaluate their performance.

3. The notebook provides detailed explanations for each step along with visualization of the results.

## Results

The machine learning models' performance metrics (F1 score, logistic regression, precision score, recall score) will be presented to assess how well they predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. Visualizations are also provided to illustrate the importance of various factors influencing the survival rate.
